# ProKabaddiHackathon

### Kabaddi
### Introduction/How to Play
Kabaddi is simple: two teams of seven players each face off in a large square arena for two halves of twenty minutes each. Players from each team take turns running across the center line to the other team's half of the court, tagging members of the other team, and running back. The more opposing team members they tag, the more points they score, but if the opposing team can physically prevent them from crossing back to their side of the court, they score no points

### Interesting Facts about Kabaddi and the Pro Kabaddi League:
There have been three kabaddi world cups so far (the fourth one will be held this year), and India won the title all three times in the men’s category. Interestingly, Iran was the runner-up in all the three world cups.

The Indian women’s kabaddi team also won all the three world cups organised so far.
